    Ape tags, Mp4 files, ASF files, and Ogg Vorbis files.

12/2/2011 - xingheader.cpp (original author Ismael Orenstein):
  - Modified the parse() method to check for a "LAME" encoder frame in the
    Xing header, and extract encoder delay values if present.
  - Added the public method isVbr() which returns a bool indicating whether
    or not a Xing vbr header is present.
  - Added the public method startDelay() which returns a uint specifying the
    number of samples in the encoder start delay if a "LAME" encoder frame
    was found in the Xing header.
  - Added the public method endDelay() which returns a uint specifying the
    number of samples in the encoder end delay if a "LAME" encoder frame
    was found in the Xing header.

12/2/2011 - xingheader.h (original author Ismael Orenstein):
  - Added method declarations for the isValid(), startDelay(), and
    endDelay() methods.
