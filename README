Building TagLib 1.7 for MyTunes Music Manager:

TagLib uses the CMake build system. These instructions explain how to build TagLib for use
on an Android device with MyTunes Music Manager. Note that these instructions are for Linux
only. You should be able to build it on Windows using Cygwin, however, I only do Android
development on Linux, so do not ask about Windows.

The build scripts used were created with the help of the android-cmake project. For more
information, see:

http://code.google.com/p/android-cmake/

1) To build TagLib you need the following installed on your system: CMake, the Android SDK,
   and the Android NDK. I use version 6b of the ndk (android-ndk-r6b), but other versions
   should work.

2) Modify the "build.sh" script to point to the correct directories on your system for the
   Android NDK tools.

3) Execute "build.sh". This will invoke cmake with the correct build options and then call
   "make" to build shared libraries for the armv7a armv5te architectures. The resulting
   libraries will be placed under the "build" subdirectory.

To install the new TagLib shared libraries on your Android device, your device must be
rooted and you must have access to the file system via the adb tool, or through DDMS
in eclipse. Place the new shared libraries in "/data/data/com.whitestar.mytunes/lib"
and restart MyTunes. The app will now be using the new libraries.
